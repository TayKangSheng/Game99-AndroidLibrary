#  Game 42

This android game is build by a group of 4.<br>
To our fellow earth beings we might appear to be building this for a university CS course called Elements of Software Construction, 
but under the cover we are answering <p>`The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.`</p>

<strong>Things to note:</strong><br>
the game will only work with wi-fi connections (unless you are a hyper-intelligent, pan-dimentional being
who emits wifi signals).
<br><br>
<strong>Developper:</strong><br>
if you are getting server connection error, 
try:<br>
1. adding the <code>*.jar</code> files to your android library.<br>
2. adding <code>\<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"\></code> to your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.

Don't panic<br>
and oh,<br>
<em>bring a towel.</em>
